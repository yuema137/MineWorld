# Human review queue

**Only large integrated milestones belong here.** Not individual PRs, structs, components, events,
dependency choices or refactors — the pi-agent owns routine engineering review. A milestone earns
a place here when a coherent capability can be *experienced* as a whole.

Engineering progress is tracked separately in [`MVP_STATUS.md`](MVP_STATUS.md). A milestone parked
here does not block anything else.

**Updated:** 2026-09-27

## Framework milestones

| | Milestone | Demonstrates | State |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **A** | Runnable world runtime | load Social Café → server → 2D + 3D clients → cause a change → both observe it → restart → state survives | 🚧 in progress (05c, 05d) |
| **B** | Persistent people and social life | Alice and Bob persist, know each other, share an activity, and survive a restart with their history | ❌ |
| **C** | Objects and everyday economy | Market Town: work → earn → buy → inventory changes → another client sees it → persists | ❌ |
| **D** | LM-native persistent characters | speak to Alice in 2D, meet her in 3D, and she reacts consistently with what happened | ❌ |
| **E** | Package composition | a real world assembled from independently installable packs | ❌ |

## Default-style milestones — taste, and the operator decides

These are candidates until the operator says otherwise (`ARC-11`). An agent may build and
recommend; it may not declare something the default look.

Named per `ARC-20`, because with two 3D tracks running (`ARC-18`) "the 3D character" no longer
identifies one thing.

| | Milestone | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **VIS-2D-1** | Playable 2D default scene with an enterable interior | 🚧 candidate in progress |
| **VIS-3D-GODOT-1** | Reference-matched character in Godot | ❌ **failed fidelity gate 2026-09-27** — rebuilding |
| **VIS-3D-GODOT-2** | Integrated Godot slice: character, street, enterable building, interior, lighting, cameras | ❌ |
| **VIS-3D-UE5-1** | Unreal slice of equivalent scope | ❌ architecture spike phase |
| **VIS-3D-AB-1** | Godot vs Unreal side-by-side, same reference, same scope | ❌ |

`VIS-3D-GODOT-1` failed on categorical identity mismatch, not polish: the reference is a young
woman in an open burgundy zip hoodie and the candidate was a man in a red quilted puffer jacket
(`ARC-17`). The rig, retarget, animation, cadence, footwear and ground-contact work underneath it
is unaffected and is kept.

### What a review package contains (`ARC-20`)

Milestone id · what changed · **the exact launch command** · real runtime screenshots · the
canonical reference · a side-by-side where applicable · known limitations · the specific
subjective questions being asked. The operator must be able to launch, look, walk and judge
quickly. An engineering log is not a review artefact.

### Reaching review does not stop work

On `READY FOR HUMAN VISUAL REVIEW`: preserve the runnable candidate, save the screenshots, record
it here, **stop subjective polishing on that branch**, and move to independent work. Review is a
branch-level checkpoint, never a global barrier. Neither 3D track waits on the other, and none of
the framework milestones wait on any of them.

## Style infrastructure — architecture, and it never waits here

Tracked in [`MVP_STATUS.md`](MVP_STATUS.md), listed only so the split is visible: Presentation and
Asset Pack interfaces, style manifest schema, provenance, generation-pipeline integration,
renderer bindings, style switching, validation and composition. None of it blocks on a taste
decision, and none of it may be tied to whichever style happens to be default.

## Open questions for the operator, not blocking anything

- **The project's name.** Microsoft published an unrelated "MineWorld" in 2025 — a video-generative
  world model — with a paper, a repository and a Hugging Face presence. Purely a discoverability
  and package-naming collision (`ARC-12`), and it blocks no engineering. Worth a deliberate
  decision before public launch rather than discovering it in a search result.

## Accepted, not to be re-litigated

- **The 2D and 3D presentation direction**, as of 2026-09-27. Movement, camera work and the
  3D lighting rig are accepted; the visual track now improves fidelity toward the references
  rather than re-deciding the direction.
- **Procedural SVG is retired as the 2D art strategy**, keeping its layout, placement, projection,
  camera and occlusion logic. Visuals get replaced; architecture does not.
- **Primitive humanoids are below baseline** and are being replaced by a reusable rigged pipeline.
- **The default character is an identity reconstruction of `04_character_closeup.png`**
  (`ARC-19`), which supersedes `ARC-4`'s facial-fidelity exclusion for that one image. `ARC-4`'s
  reasoning survives, applied to the right object: the bar is high for **our** default character,
  which we pay once and ship as an asset, and stays low for **what the framework requires**, which
  is the humanoid profile and nothing about appearance.
