## ARC-3 — A style that spans dimensions is several packs, not one

**Date** 2026-09-25

The default style now has both 2D and 3D references. `ART_DIRECTION.md` §15 gives `dimension` as
a list, which suggests one pack could declare `[2d, 3d]`.

**Decided: one family directory, one pack per dimension.** `presentation/mineworld-default/`
contains `2D/` and `3D/`, each with its own manifest, art direction and references.

**Why, from the references rather than from taste.** The 3D references use realistic human
proportions; the 2D references are stylized. A single manifest would have to state one value for
`characters.proportions`, and whichever it stated would be false for half of its own reference
images. The same applies to `materials.physically_based` and `stylization`. A manifest that
contradicts its references is worse than no manifest, because the references are the source of
truth (§16) and the manifest is supposed to summarise them.

**What the family directory carries** is the part that genuinely is shared: the mood, and the
rule that both packs express identical semantics. `dimension` stays a list in the schema — a
style whose values really are identical across dimensions may still declare both.

**Consequence for the creator flow (§23):** choosing 2D or 3D selects which pack is being
authored. A creator who wants both answers the question twice, with their own references each
time, which is also the honest thing to ask of them.
