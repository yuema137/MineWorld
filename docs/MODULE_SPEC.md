# MineWorld — Module Specification

**Status:** frozen module model for v0.1 planning
**Audience:** coding agents. This document defines what can be published, installed, and
composed. It is the boundary that separates MineWorld from a fork-and-edit starter kit.

Vocabulary: [`CORE_CONCEPTS.md`](CORE_CONCEPTS.md). Layering: [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md).

# 1. Six pack types

```text
Entity Pack        what exists in the world
System Pack        what is allowed to happen between the things that exist
World Pack         a specific world: population, places, organizations, initial state, config
Controller Pack    who decides what a character does      (also: Cognition Pack)
Presentation Pack  how the world is rendered
Asset Pack         the models, images, textures, animation and audio it is rendered from
```

A seventh kind of pack is a design change, not a convenience. Adding one requires changing this
document — which is exactly how `Asset Pack` arrived, as `ARC-7` records. Packaging, formats and
extension tiers for all six are specified in [`PACKAGE_FORMAT.md`](PACKAGE_FORMAT.md).

Extension model:

```text
install modules  →  compose world  →  configure  →  run
```

Never:

```text
fork source  →  modify game code  →  modify agent  →  modify frontend
```

---

# 2. Entity Pack

Declares the kinds of things that can exist. An Entity Pack contains no gameplay rules: it
cannot make anything happen.

```text
Modern Life Pack        Space Colony Pack
Person                  Human
Vehicle                 Android
Food                    Spaceship
Phone                   Spacesuit
Building                OxygenTank
Furniture               Airlock
Money
Pet
```

Contents:

```text
entity type definitions
component schemas the pack introduces as data shapes
item types
tags and taxonomies
authoring templates
```

Constraint: an Entity Pack declares structure. Behavior requires a System Pack. Installing
`Vehicle` without a transport system yields an object that exists and does nothing — which is
correct, not broken.

---

# 3. System Pack

Declares what is *allowed to happen*. This is where composability lives.

```text
ConversationSystem   InventorySystem     EconomySystem
EmploymentSystem     VehicleSystem       CombatSystem
RomanceSystem        EducationSystem     PropertySystem
CraftingSystem       InteriorSystem      GroupActivitySystem
```

A System Pack declares, per [`CORE_CONCEPTS.md`](CORE_CONCEPTS.md) §13:

```text
ID
Version
Dependencies

Owned Components        the only state it may write
Provided Actions        what becomes possible in a world that enables it
Emitted Events
Subscribed Events

Configuration Schema
Migration Schema
```

Composition changes the genre while `Person` stays untouched:

```yaml
# World A — walking and talking
systems: [movement, conversation]
```

```yaml
# World B — life simulation
systems: [movement, conversation, inventory, economy, employment, property]
```

```yaml
# World C — survival
systems: [movement, inventory, crafting, survival, combat]
```

Hard constraints on a System Pack:

1. It writes only the components it owns; cross-domain effects are emitted as events (INV-7).
2. It never assumes the presence of a system it does not declare as a dependency.
3. It never references renderer assets, transports, or model providers (INV-14).
4. Removing it removes its actions and its state contribution without requiring edits to
   `Person`, to other systems, or to the kernel.

# 4. World Pack

What a world author actually produces: semantic configuration and population, not code.

```text
lakewood/
├── world.yaml
├── people/
│   ├── alice.yaml
│   └── bob.yaml
├── places/
│   ├── cafe.yaml
│   ├── apartments.yaml
│   └── park.yaml
├── items/
├── organizations/
├── scenarios/
└── dependencies.yaml
```

```yaml
world:
  name: Lakewood
  id: lakewood
  era: 2026
  calendar: modern
  geography: pacific_northwest

entity_packs:
  - modern-life

systems:
  - conversation
  - relationships
  - inventory
  - economy
  - employment
  - property

population:
  - alice
  - bob
  - charlie

cognition_profile:
  default: local_agents

presentation_profile:
  default: lakewood_realistic

network_profile:
  default: private_server
```

Constraints:

1. A World Pack contains no secrets and no credentials. It declares required *capabilities*;
   the operator supplies endpoints and keys.
2. A World Pack contains no renderer-specific assets; it names a Presentation Pack.
3. A World Pack never redefines simulation rules. If a world needs a new rule, that is a
   System Pack.

---

# 5. Controller Pack (Cognition Pack)

Declares who decides what a Person attempts.

```text
Human Controller
Rule Controller
Behavior Tree Controller
LM Controller
RL Controller
Script Controller
```

A Controller Pack may define:

```text
agent policy
memory policy
planning
prompting
model routing
cognition budgets
```

Mixed control within one world is normal:

```text
Alice   → human
Bob     → local Qwen
Charlie → cloud model
David   → deterministic NPC
Emma    → RL policy
```

Hard constraints:

1. A Controller Pack **cannot create new interactions**. With `CombatSystem` disabled, "I
   shoot Bob" returns `ActionUnavailable` (INV-10).
2. It consumes `Observation`s only; it never reads global world state (INV-13).
3. It emits `ActionIntent`s only; it never mutates state (INV-6).
4. Rebinding a Person's controller preserves that Person's biography, relationships,
   inventory, and employment (INV-1).
5. Provider-specific details stay behind the model-backend interface; cognition contracts stay
   provider-neutral.

---

# 6. Presentation Pack

Declares how a world looks and sounds.

```text
sprites
models
animations
architecture style
sounds
UI
lighting
materials
```

Examples for one semantic world: `Lakewood Pixel`, `Lakewood Godot 3D`, `Lakewood Anime`,
`Lakewood Realistic UE`.

Hard constraint: swapping a Presentation Pack changes nothing about the simulation. The same
`Person: Alice / Place: Cafe / Action: make_coffee` becomes a sprite animation, a skeletal
animation with a coffee-machine interaction, or the line `08:32 Alice starts making coffee.`
in a text client.

A Presentation Pack may describe how an interaction *looks*. It may never define whether the
interaction is *valid*: `Sit(actor, bench)` belongs to a System, and the pack only decides
whether that is a seat anchor with a sit animation or a sprite swapping to a seated frame
([`ART_DIRECTION.md`](ART_DIRECTION.md) §19).

## 6.1 Structure: the Presentation Style Pack

A Presentation Pack's internal structure is specified by
[`ART_DIRECTION.md`](ART_DIRECTION.md) §12, where it is called a **Presentation Style Pack**.
That is the same pack type given a concrete layout, not a sixth kind of module
([`DECISIONS.md`](DECISIONS.md) `ARC-1`):

```text
presentation/<style-id>/
  manifest.yaml            compact machine-readable summary
  references/              the images that actually define the style
  ART_DIRECTION.md         human-readable direction
  assets/asset_bindings.yaml
  materials/material_rules.yaml
  characters/character_style.yaml
  lighting/lighting_profile.yaml
  renderer/godot.yaml, renderer/unreal.yaml
  generation/optional_prompt_guidelines.md
```

Not every pack needs every directory. A style that covers more than one dimension is more than
one pack, grouped in a family directory, because one manifest cannot describe two dimensions
whose character proportions differ (`DECISIONS.md` `ARC-3`). The shipped default:

```text
presentation/mineworld-default/
├── README.md     what the family is, and what the packs must share
├── 2D/           manifest.yaml · ART_DIRECTION.md · references/
└── 3D/           manifest.yaml · ART_DIRECTION.md · references/
``` The reference images are the source of truth; the manifest
summarises them, and a generation prompt is an implementation aid rather than the contract
(§16).

## 6.2 Authoring a style

Creating a style does not mean writing that manifest by hand
([`ART_DIRECTION.md`](ART_DIRECTION.md) §23):

```text
New Presentation Style → upload 4–10 references → write two or three sentences
→ choose 2D / 3D → the system generates an initial manifest → the creator corrects it
```

This is why the manifest schema must stay small: every field has to be inferable from images,
chosen by the creator, or fixed by project policy. A field that is none of those does not belong
in it.

---

# 6.3 Asset Pack

Declares the material a presentation is made of: models, images, textures, animation, audio.

```text
mineworld-assets-modern-town/
  manifest.yaml
  previews/
  models/      cafe.glb · house_01.glb · grocery.glb
  materials/
  textures/
  LICENSES/
```

Separate from Presentation Pack because the same bench, tree and café model are reused across
styles and across worlds; binding them to one style would force a copy per style. A Presentation
Pack declares which asset families it is compatible with:

```yaml
compatible_asset_tags: [semi-realistic-modern, realistic-scale, medium-detail]
```

Canonical model format is glTF 2.0, `.glb` preferred; no engine-native scene format is ever a
published asset. Each asset carries an `asset.yaml` whose `semantic_bindings` attach it to world
meaning — entrances, interaction anchors, spaces — without the world knowing what a mesh is. Full
contract in [`PACKAGE_FORMAT.md`](PACKAGE_FORMAT.md) §3.

Hard constraint, the same one every presentation-side pack carries: an interaction anchor says
where a `Sit` is *rendered*, never whether sitting is *allowed*.

# 7. Composition

```text
Modern Life Entity Pack
+ Conversation System
+ Relationship System
+ Employment System
+ Local LM Controller Pack
+ Pixel Presentation Pack
= a game
```

Replace one line:

```text
+ Realistic 3D Presentation Pack
= the same world, rendered differently
```

Two semantically identical worlds, different presentation:

```text
Lakewood World Pack + Modern Life Systems + Local-LLM Cognition + Pixel Presentation
Lakewood World Pack + Modern Life Systems + Local-LLM Cognition + Photorealistic UE Presentation
```

---

# 8. Installation and composition workflow

Intended creator experience:

```bash
mineworld install modern-life
mineworld install employment
mineworld install restaurant
mineworld install relationships
mineworld install godot-realistic

mineworld create my-town
mineworld add-system university
mineworld run worlds/my-town --headless
```

After `add-system university`, the world gains `University`, `Student`, `Professor`,
`Course`, `Enroll`, `AttendClass`, `TakeExam`, `Graduate` without the world author
implementing a university simulation. That leverage is the reason the pack system exists.

The command surface above is the intended shape, not a frozen CLI contract; the CLI is
specified in the PR that implements it.

---

# 9. Dependencies, versions, and migration

Every pack declares:

```text
id
version
dependencies          other packs and version ranges
requires              capabilities, never secrets
provides              components, actions, events, entity types, assets
configuration schema
migration schema      how existing worlds move to a new version
```

Rules:

1. Version core contracts where long-term compatibility matters; a change to a core contract
   is a deliberate review, not an incidental edit
   ([`ENGINEERING_STANDARDS.md`](ENGINEERING_STANDARDS.md) §13).
2. A pack that changes an owned component's schema ships a migration for existing saves, since
   world history is durable ([`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) §7).
3. Before MineWorld publishes stable public contracts, a wrong interface is fixed cleanly
   rather than wrapped in adapters (§29 of the standards).

---

# 10. Capabilities and sandboxing

```text
v0     trusted Rust systems, trusted Python extensions
later  WASM component plugins
```

A pack requests capabilities explicitly:

```text
world.read.person
world.read.place
world.emit.event
```

Network and filesystem access are never implicit. A pack that needs an outbound endpoint
declares it and the operator grants it.

---

# 11. What the community publishes

Not mods against a fork — composable packages:

```text
1990s American Small Town      Modern Tokyo
University Campus              Space Colony
Medieval Village               Research Station
Cruise Ship
```

One framework runs them all. If a published pack requires patching the kernel to work, the
pack model has failed and that is an architecture bug in MineWorld, not in the pack.
