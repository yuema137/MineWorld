# MineWorld decision log

**Status:** durable, project-level decisions
**Audience:** coding agents and contributors.

This log holds decisions that outlive any single effort — dependencies, build-versus-adopt
calls, and architectural routes. It exists so that a future contributor does not replace or
duplicate something without knowing why it is there
([`REUSE_POLICY.md`](REUSE_POLICY.md) §§11–12).

Effort-scoped planning decisions (`D-1`, `D-2`, …) stay in that effort's plan under
`.structured-coding/plans/<effort>/`. Decisions here are referenced by id (`DEP-n`, `ARC-n`) and
are never silently reversed: superseding one means adding a new record that says so.

Record format is deliberately short: problem, options, choice, why not ourselves (or why not
them), the interface that isolates it, and the limitation we accepted.

## ARC-1 — A Presentation Style Pack is not a sixth pack type

**Date** 2026-09-25

[`ART_DIRECTION.md`](ART_DIRECTION.md) §12 introduces the "Presentation Style Pack" as a
first-class concept, while [`MODULE_SPEC.md`](MODULE_SPEC.md) §1 states that exactly five pack
types exist and that adding a sixth is a deliberate design change.

**Resolved as: the same type, now with a specified structure.** A Presentation Style Pack is the
internal layout of the Presentation Pack that `MODULE_SPEC.md` §6 already defines — manifest,
references, art direction, asset bindings, material rules, character style, lighting profile,
renderer configs. The name is used where the art-direction aspect is what matters.

**Why not a sixth type.** Nothing in §12 describes a different *kind* of module: it does not
add entities, rules, controllers, or world content, and it is installed and swapped exactly as a
Presentation Pack is. Adding a type to the core ontology to describe a directory layout would be
the ontology bloat the project explicitly guards against
([`CORE_CONCEPTS.md`](CORE_CONCEPTS.md) §1).

**Recorded because** a future contributor reading §12 alone would reasonably conclude the
ontology has six types. It has five.

## ARC-2 — The style manifest is generated from references, which constrains the schema

**Date** 2026-09-25

Style authoring is meant to be: upload 4–10 references, write two or three sentences, choose 2D or
3D, and let the system generate an initial manifest
([`ART_DIRECTION.md`](ART_DIRECTION.md) §23).

**Consequence, and the reason this is a decision rather than a feature note:** every manifest
field must be *inferable from images*, *chosen by the creator*, or *fixed by project policy*.
Auditing the §15 example against that rule already separates three kinds of field, and exposes
that `readability_priority` and `human_scale` were never style at all — gameplay readability
outranks decorative density for every MineWorld style, so they are project invariants a style
restates rather than choices a style makes.

**Applied as a rule:** a proposed manifest field that is none of the three is rejected. This is
what keeps §15's "do not overengineer an exhaustive universal art ontology" enforceable instead of
aspirational.

**Limitation:** the analysis reads style only. It may never infer simulation content from a
reference image — a café with outdoor seating says nothing about whether `Sit` exists in a world.

## DEP-1 — Component storage: purpose-built, not an ECS

**Date** 2026-09-25 · **Supersedes** effort decision `D-5`, which is now this record

**Problem.** Store typed component state keyed by entity, where each component type is owned by
exactly one system, systems are installed and removed per world, all state is serializable, and
the whole store is reconstructible from an append-only event log.

**Options considered.** `bevy_ecs`, `hecs`, `shipyard`, `legion`, `specs`, `edict`; or a
purpose-built typed store.

**Choice: purpose-built**, one component table per owning system, keyed by `EntityId`.

**Why not an ECS.** Three mismatches, in order of severity.

1. *Identity.* Almost every Rust ECS uses generational handles that are not stable across a
   save/load cycle; `bevy_ecs` is the notable exception with globally unique ids. MineWorld's
   `EntityId` must be stable, serializable, and referenced by events that outlive the process
   ([`CORE_CONCEPTS.md`](CORE_CONCEPTS.md) §3, `AC-6`).
2. *What they optimize.* Archetype storage buys cache-friendly iteration over tens of thousands
   of entities per frame. MineWorld ticks semantically over hundreds of entities and spends its
   budget on causality, persistence and migration instead. We would pay the complexity and gain
   nothing measurable.
3. *Ownership.* `INV-7` requires that a system can only write components it owns. An ECS hands
   any system `&mut World`, so single-writer would degrade to a review convention — the exact
   guarantee the composability claim rests on
   ([`ENGINEERING_RULES.md`](ENGINEERING_RULES.md) §15).

Dynamic registration is a fourth, smaller mismatch: System Packs declare component types at load
time, which archetype ECSs support awkwardly, and serialization of dynamically registered types
generally needs a reflection layer we would then also own.

**Why not ourselves is weaker here.** This is `REUSE_POLICY.md` §7's third case: study the
implementations, build the smaller MineWorld-specific version. The store is a `BTreeMap` per
component type behind a narrow API, not a subsystem.

**Isolating interface.** The kernel's component-store API. If entity counts ever make iteration
the bottleneck, the internals can be replaced — including by an ECS — without touching systems,
because systems never see the storage.

**Accepted limitations.** We maintain this code. Iteration performance is far below an archetype
ECS, which is acceptable at MVP scale and is the thing to re-measure before it is not. No
built-in parallel scheduling; determinism (`AC-12`) currently matters more than parallelism.

**Licenses.** All candidates are MIT/Apache-2.0 and would have been compatible.

## DEP-2 — Persistence: `rusqlite` behind `PersistenceBackend`

**Date** 2026-09-25 · **Status** selected, integrated in S5

**Problem.** Durable local world state and an append-only event log, with a cloud backend later
([`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) §8).

**Options.** `rusqlite`, `sqlx`, `diesel`, `sea-orm`, or a file format of our own.

**Choice: `rusqlite` with the `bundled` feature**, which compiles SQLite into the binary so a
local server has no system dependency — directly serving the local-hosting requirement in
[`NETWORKING.md`](NETWORKING.md) §6.

**Why not the others.** `sqlx` is async-first with compile-time query checking, which suits a
service talking to a remote database; our persistence is local and sits behind a blocking task,
so its async model buys nothing and costs build complexity. It is also a semver hazard alongside
`rusqlite`, since only one crate version may link `libsqlite3-sys`. An ORM is the wrong shape for
event sourcing, where rows are append-only facts rather than mapped objects. Writing our own file
format would be rebuilding commodity infrastructure (`REUSE_POLICY.md` §4) and losing crash
safety we would then have to prove.

**Isolating interface.** `PersistenceBackend`, with `SqliteBackend` as the first implementation
and Postgres later through the same trait. No SQL or SQLite type appears in the kernel or in any
system.

**Accepted limitations.** Synchronous API bridged with `spawn_blocking`. Single-writer concurrency
model, which matches an authoritative single-world server and would need revisiting only for
multi-world processes.

## DEP-3 — Server and transport: `tokio` + `axum`

**Date** 2026-09-25 · **Status** selected, spike-proven, integrated in S11

**Problem.** HTTP control plane and WebSocket streams for observations and intents
([`NETWORKING.md`](NETWORKING.md) §3), identical for localhost, LAN and cloud.

**Options.** `axum`, `actix-web`, `warp`, `poem`, `hyper` directly, or raw `tokio-tungstenite`.

**Choice: `axum` on `tokio`**, with `axum`'s WebSocket support.

**Why.** It is a focused library over `hyper` rather than a framework demanding we adopt its
execution model (`REUSE_POLICY.md` §3), the stack is already the Rust default named in
[`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) §13, and a spike on 2026-09-25 round-tripped an
`ActionIntent` and an `ActionResult` between a Godot client and an `axum` server before any
commitment was made (§15).

**Isolating interface.** A transport module owning the socket lifecycle; the kernel never sees an
HTTP or WebSocket type, and simulation semantics are transport-independent (`INV-14`).

**Accepted limitations.** JSON over WebSocket is not a compact encoding; acceptable for a life
simulation, and replaceable behind the same boundary. The wire encoding must render 64-bit ids as
strings — see the S2 plan's DD-15 and risk R-9, a defect found by that same spike.

## DEP-4 — Presentation: Godot 4.7 for both reference clients

**Date** 2026-09-25 · **Status** selected, spike-proven

**Problem.** A 2D client and an embodied 3D client, neither of which may contain a world rule
([`ENGINEERING_RULES.md`](ENGINEERING_RULES.md) §§2, 8, 10).

**Choice: Godot 4.7.2 for both**, as [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) §13 already named.

**What we reuse rather than build**, all listed as commodity in `REUSE_POLICY.md` §4: the
renderer, physics and collision, the character controller (`CharacterBody3D`), camera, raycast
targeting, input handling, UI layer, and later navigation. MineWorld writes none of this.

**Why not something else.** Unreal is heavier for a low-fidelity embodied demo and is already
planned as a later adapter. A browser stack would have been viable and easier for me to automate,
but it would deviate from the frozen spec for a convenience reason, and the verification concern
it addressed turned out not to exist.

**Evidence before commitment.** Installed, then verified in three steps: headless script
execution; a windowed run rendering through Metal with `save_png` producing an inspectable image;
and an embodied spike that walked a collidable room, raycast-targeted an NPC by entity id, and
rendered a server-supplied affordance.

**Isolating interface.** The client speaks only the wire protocol. Engine types never enter a
contract (`ENGINEERING_RULES.md` §12), and the S14 adversarial criterion is that deleting the 3D
client changes no system and touches no kernel contract.

**Accepted limitations.** GDScript is a second language at the presentation boundary, which the
standards permit for renderer adapters. Godot's JSON parses numbers as doubles, handled at the
protocol boundary rather than in the contracts.

## DEP-5 — Serialization: `serde`

**Date** 2026-09-25 · **Status** selected, in use since S1

`serde` with derive for every contract type, `serde_json` for the wire and for tests. The Rust
ecosystem standard, zero operational burden, and format-agnostic so a binary encoding later needs
no contract change. `thiserror` accompanies it for typed errors, which
[`ENGINEERING_STANDARDS.md`](ENGINEERING_STANDARDS.md) §12 requires anyway. Both MIT/Apache-2.0.

---

## DEP-6 — Scheduler: purpose-built discrete-event queue *(provisional, S4)*

**Date** 2026-09-25 · **Status** recommendation, decided when S4 is designed

No Rust discrete-event-simulation crate is both maintained and shaped like a game world clock
with interruptible processes and deterministic tie-breaking. The likely answer is a
`BinaryHeap`-based queue in the kernel — small, and the determinism rules (`AC-12`) are ours to
define. Recorded now so S4 revisits it deliberately rather than by default, per
`REUSE_POLICY.md` §12: a custom implementation still needs its justification written down.
